# docker-selfhosted-server
My Hobby Server for Self-Hosted Applications on Docker

## Usage

In each application directory resides a `sample-env` file, which includes the required environment variables that you can copy to `.env`:

```
$ cd folder/
$ cp sample-env .env
# modify .env to desired values
```

## Included Applications

I will add more over time:

- `traefik`
- `bitwarden`
- `rocket-chat`
- `grafana loki`
